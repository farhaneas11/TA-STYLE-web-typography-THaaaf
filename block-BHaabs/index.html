    <h1>Proper article</h1>
    <div>

    <p>A proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person,
         the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The Maori language has the proper article a, which is used for personal nouns; 
         so, "a Pita" means "Peter". In Maori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it,
          both articles are present; for example, the phrase "a Te Rauparaha",
         which contains both the proper article a and the definite article Te refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.</p>
    <p><blockquote> The definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there is just one of them). For example: the Amazon, the Hebrides. 
        In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. the Amazon River, 
        the Hebridean Islands.[citation needed] Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: the United Stat
        the People's Republic of China. This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage the Ukraine stressed the word's Russian meaning of "borderlands"; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
        it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and both Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred with The Gambia. In certain languages, such as French and Italian,
         definite articles </blockquote> are used with all or most names of countries: la France/le Canada/l'Allemagne, l'Italia/la Spagna/il Brasile.</p>
    <h2>Partitive article</h2>
    <p><q> A partitive article is a type of article, </q> sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with a mass noun such as water,
        to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of determiner; 
        they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. 
        In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) 
        The nearest equivalent in English is some, although it is classified as a determiner, 
        and English uses it less than French uses de.   </p>
    <p>A negative article specifies none of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. 
        On the other hand, <cite> some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article.</cite>
         In English, this function is fulfilled by no, which can appear before a singular or plural noun:</p>
